Matt Parker Conjecture
======================

    this is an attempt to extend the work done by matt parker. my
first attempt actually calculated pi^pi^n, n in [1, 10]. once i get
pi^pi^pi^... i will continue using rust to calculate pi^pi^pi... for
truncated values of pi, then analyse the data using r so i can make
pretty graphs and such like.

    in terms of libraries, i am using rug
[https://gitlab.com/tspiteri/rug] to deal with the heavy amount of
numbers

    i didn't really know much of what i was doing, aside from the
maths [or so i thought] so i found a nice article to help:
[https://blog.demofox.org/2017/11/21/floating-point-precision/]

    despite this, im still not certain if one hundred million bits
of precision on the floats is necessary, so im figuring that despite
it taking forever to calculate, better safe than sorry - i want good
numbers :)
